            a unique venue built into Ilfracombe's cliffs and accessed through
            hand-carved tunnels dating back to the 1820s. The venue has a
            private beach for all our guests to use during the day - as well as
            sea water bathing pools for swimming. Fingers crossed for sunshine!

            Getting there
          </h2>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2">
            Tunnels Beaches is conveniently located right in the heart of
            Ilfracombe, and is very easy to find once you arrive in town. As the
            wedding is during peak tourist season, so we recommend allowing some
            extra travel time to ensure a relaxed journey if you're planning to
            visit on the day.
            <br />
            <br />
            For public transport, simply take a train to Barnstaple station,
            then catch the direct bus service from there to Ilfracombe
          </p>

            Staying in Ilfracombe
          </h2>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2 mb-4">
            There are lots of great places to stay within walking distance of
            the venue. A couple of the larger hotels nearby include
            <strong

                >The Carlton Hotel</NuxtLink

            and
            <strong

                external

                >The Osborne Hotel</NuxtLink
              ></strong
            >, both popular with wedding guests.
          </p>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2 mb-4">
            Beyond that, Ilfracombe has a huge number of cosy B&Bs and plenty of
            holiday homes to suit different budgets.
          </p>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2">
            Because it's August and the town gets busy, we recommend booking
            your accommodation as soon as possible.
          </p>

            Staying elsewhere

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2 mb-4">
            If you'd like to make more of a trip out of your stay, Woolacombe
            and Saunton both offer stunning beaches and dramatic coastal
            scenery, with plenty of places to stay.
          </p>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2 mb-4">
            We especially recommend Croyde â€” a cute village with thatched
            cottages, a gorgeous beach, and a laid-back surfer vibe.
          </p>

          <p class="body-1 brown--text text--darken-2">
            All are only about a 20-30 minute drive from Tunnels Beaches.
